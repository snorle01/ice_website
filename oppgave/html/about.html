        <b><p class="center_text">Hi. My name is Isaac, and i own this business. I inherited this business after my father sliped on an ice cube and hit his head. My father was an expert on delivering ice cubes back in the old days when we had to deliver them by hand. His hands was always cold when he got back home.</p>
        <p class="center_text">We pride ourself on bringing quality ice to our customers, so they can have the best ice experience in america. We advise you to not use normal tap water and freeze the ice yourself as that ice will allways be lower quality then ours, and it will put us out of buisness.</p></b>
